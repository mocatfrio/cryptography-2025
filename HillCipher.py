    plaintext = "Hello Cyber Fox, attacker here! Cryptography is crucial for safeguarding information in computing systems and plays an integral role in the daily lives of billions of people worldwide by ensuring the security of both stored and transmitted data. As a core component of many security protocols, particularly Transport Layer Security (TLS), cryptographic methods provide strong encryption across various applications. However, despite its significance, cryptography remains vulnerableâ€”its security can be entirely compromised by a single design flaw or coding error. Traditional software testing techniques, such as unit testing, are inadequate for identifying cryptographic weaknesses. Instead, cryptographic security is reinforced through rigorous mathematical proofs and formal analysis to verify adherence to critical security principles, often based on reasonable assumptions. One of the early encryption techniques that advanced beyond simple substitution ciphers is the Hill cipher, developed in the 20th century. Unlike monoalphabetic ciphers, the Hill cipher uses linear algebra and matrix multiplication to encrypt blocks of letters simultaneously, making it more resistant to frequency analysis. However, despite its mathematical sophistication, it can be decrypted if an attacker obtains enough plaintext-ciphertext pairs, allowing them to solve for the encryption matrix. This highlights a fundamental principle in modern cryptography: true security relies not just on secrecy but also on solid mathematical foundations and computational infeasibility."
